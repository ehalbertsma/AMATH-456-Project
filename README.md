### Abstract
Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have been adapted as sensors or actuators in a number of aerospace technologies. SMAs can exhibit unique hysteretic behaviours due to the non-convex nature of their free energy functions. We begin with a discussion of SMAs and their properties, followed by a decription of variational approaches to modeling SMAs in Chapter 2. Next, we offer some examples of the numerous applications of SMAs as sensors and actuators in the aerospace industry, including present and future uses. Finally, we briefly outline the formalism behind a continuous time model relevant to numerical simulation and discuss a computational model of Nitinol.
